    <br>
   This work was made after reading <i>New Seeds of Contemplation </i> by Thomas Merton and is inspired by his thoughts in the book 
    <br>as well as writings of feminist new materialism. Here I hope to question notions of the real and what it might mean for 
    <br>imaginary objects to interact together under our gaze.<br><br>

        Made in 2020 in my Brooklyn apartment, shut in by myself during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
        <br>my series of pig 3D renders explore the idea of the visitor, whether welcome or unwelcome. 
        <br>In this image, the 3D model is composited into my bedroom, in an almost cruciform position. 
        <br>Looking back, this work might represent the intrusive capitalist ‘pig’ I felt constantly around me, 
        <br>alone in the pandemic, with my only connection to others being mediated by capitalist 
        <br>media streams such as youtube and instagram - of this, I am unsure.

    <br>joined in hands they celebrated what they could is an interactive hypertext story. 
    <br>The narrative follows a group of people gathering for some type of celebration 
    <br>and looks at the various emotions those joined in hands feel.

    <br>instructions for a performance/game
    <br><br>
    Lounging/Longing is a written set of suggestions for a performance/game for two people. 
    <br>Expanding upon my earlier written instruction work that pulled from Fluxus writings, 
    <br>this booklet, in decorated prose, lays out suggestions for two men, a painter and a lounger, 
    <br>to engage with each other in acts of intimacy. 
    <br> Although never realized, this work stands on its own as a piece of instructional art.<br>
